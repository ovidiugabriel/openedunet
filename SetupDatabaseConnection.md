# Setting up a database connection #

If you are not running on XAMPP, you have to create the CD Collection Demo table by running **sql/tables/cds.sql**.

Now you should setup a connection to a MySQL database. Set the following constants accordingly:

  * **`_`DB\_USER** - the username
  * **`_`DB\_PASS** - the password
  * **`_`DB\_HOST** - the MySQL server hostname
  * **`_`DB\_NAME** - the name of the database that is to be selected

Barebone MVC is now ready for development! You can now write Your first Barebone MVC Application.
