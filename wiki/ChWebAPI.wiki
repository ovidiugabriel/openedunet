Ch is a C/C++ dialect. It is an interpretive implementation of C with salient features from C++, other languages and software packages for scripting, rapid application development, deployment, and integration with legacy systems. 


= Types =

{{{
typedef char*  string_t;
typedef char** chstrarray;
}}}

== `FP` ==

{{{
typedef void* (*FP) (...);
}}}

= Macros =

=== `FP_CALLBACK()` ===

{{{
#define FP_CALLBACK(p)  ((FP) (p))
}}}

=== `COUNT()` ===

{{{
#define COUNT(x)        ((ssize_t)(sizeof(x)/sizeof((x)[0])))
}}}

One important thing about this macro is that the type of the resulting expression is cast to `ssize_t` - which according to POSIX standard is _Used for a count of bytes or an error indication._ We don't use it for that reason, but because there is enough representation capacity and we are not interested in operating bitwise, we shall keep it `signed` since most probably some comparisons will be done with `signed` variables.

If you have more than `2,147,483,647` elements to be counted use `UCOUNT()`.

=== `UCOUNT()` ===

{{{
#define UCOUNT(x)        (sizeof(x)/sizeof((x)[0]))
}}}


== Deferred-Shape array ==

{{{
/**
 * A deferred-shape array is an array pointer or an allocatable array. 
 */
#if defined(_CH_)
    /* Deferred-shape array is created with the syntax of the language */
    #define CREATE_DEFERRED_SHAPE_ARRAY(type, name, num)    type name[0:(num)-1]
 
#elif !defined(_SCH_)
    /* 
     * Deferred-shape array is created with dynamic allocation of the operating system.
     * When using this, always use RAII pattern. 
     * (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Resource_Acquisition_Is_Initialization)
     */
    #define CREATE_DEFERRED_SHAPE_ARRAY(type, name, num)    type* name = (type*) malloc((num) * sizeof(type))
#endif
}}}

= Functions =

=== `request_scalar()` ===

Returns the value associated with the key `name`.

{{{
string_t request_scalar(string_t name)
}}}

|| *`name`* || the name of the key ||
|| *returns* || Returns the value associated with the key `name`.  Returns an empty string if the key is not found. ||

*Limitation:* If a key exists and its value is an empty string then just by using this function you cannot tell if the key is set or not.

|| `http://localhost/cgi-bin/cgi.chf` || - || an empty string ||
|| `http://localhost/cgi-bin/cgi.chf?y` || y || <font color="red">garbage</font> ||
|| `http://localhost/cgi-bin/cgi.chf?y=` || - || an empty string ||
|| `http://localhost/cgi-bin/cgi.chf?y=0` || y || 0 ||

This does the same as calling `Request.getForm(name)`.
And it is the same as `$_REQUEST[name]` in PHP.

=== `request_array()` ===

{{{
gint request_array(string_t key, char**& vals)
}}}

|| *`key`* || ... ||
|| *`values`* || ... ||
|| *returns* || ... ||

This is the same as calling `Request.getForms(strcat(key, "[]"), vals)`.

And it is also the same as `$_REQUEST[name]` in PHP - but where it is automatically detected that `$_REQUEST[name]` is an array while in Ch CGI you have to assume (although you would say it is written it is part of an interface contract) that `name` is an array to decide to use `request_array()`.

=== `doubleval()` ===

{{{
gdouble doubleval(string_t str)
}}}

|| *`str`* || ... ||
|| *returns* || ... ||

It is the same as `doubleval()` or `floatval()` in PHP - where both `float` and `double` are on 64-bits. Here in Ch, like in C/C++, only `double` is on 64-bits.

=== `get_double_values()` ===

{{{
void get_double_values(gdouble* result, string_t* values, gint num)
}}}

|| *`result`* || ... ||
|| *`values`* || ... ||
|| *`num`* || ... ||
|| *returns* || ... ||

Of course this is the same as running `doubleval()` on `values` with `array_map()` and storing the output in `result`.

=== `array_map()` ===

{{{
void array_map(void* result, FP callback, void* values, int count)
}}}

=== `double_value_array()` ===

{{{
void double_value_array(gdouble* result, string_t* values, gint index)
}}}

== Strings ==

Types `char` and `wchar_t` are used to define variables of characters and wide characters in Ch.

The value of a variable of type `char` is a single character or escape sequence which is enclosed in singlequotes,
as in `'x'`. A character constant has type `int` in C. Like C++, a character constant has type `char` in
Ch.

|| C || `int` ||
|| C++, Ch || `char` ||

In Ch: For string functions *`strcpy()`*, *`strncpy()`*, *`strcat()`*, and *`strncat()`*, the memory will be automatically handled
if the first argument is of the type *`string t`*.

As it is mentioned above, one of the advantages of type string t is that Ch can handle the memory for variables of type string t automatically. For every operations on these variables, Ch will figure out the size
of the memory required, and then allocate enough memory for the variables. At the end of the lifetimes of these variables, Ch will free their memory automatically.

=== `strcasecmp()` ===

{{{
int strcasecmp(char *s1, char *s2);
}}}

=== `strconcat()` ===

{{{
char* strconcat (const char *string1, ...);
}}}

=== `strjoin()` ===

{{{
char* strjoin(const char *separator, ...);
}}}

=== `strncasecmp()` ===

{{{
int strncasecmp(char *s1, char *s2, int n);
}}}

=== `str2ascii()` ===

{{{
unsigned int str2ascii(char *s);
}}}

=== `str2mat()` ===

{{{
int str2mat(char mat[:][:], string_t s1, ...);
}}}

=== `strgetc()` ===

{{{
char strgetc(string_t &s, int i);
}}}

=== `strputc()` ===

{{{
int strputc(string_t &s, int i, char c);
}}}

=== `strrep()` ===

{{{
string_t strrep(string_t s1, string_t s2, string_t s3);
}}}

=== `stradd()` ===

=== `foreach` ===

In Ch the `foreach` loop is limited to the specific string tokenization that otherwise is usually done with `strtok()`.

{{{
char* strtok(char* str, const char* delim);
}}}

This way the following Ch code:

{{{
foreach (token; s; NULL; delimiter) {
    // ...
}
}}}

Is equivalent with the following PHP code:

{{{
foreach (explode($delimiter, $S) as $token) {
    // ...
}
}}}
