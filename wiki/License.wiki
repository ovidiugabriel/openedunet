#summary license of the project

= License =

Current license of this project is *Modified BSD License*.

The license was changed from original GPL2 because it is more permissive and that way it encourages business development. It removes share-alike reciprocal requirements and offer a better protection of copyright. 

Say, this change adds the advantages to use the framework in real businesses and not only in the development community. But of course, it is still open-source and free software. And it will always be.
