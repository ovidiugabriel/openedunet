= Configuration Class =
The _Config_ class is a *Key-Value-Type store*.

That is a key-value store, but inside each value caries its own associated type.

Without using this feature, each time you request a field value from a database you will get a string - and you have to manually convert the value to the assumed type. _Maybe the assumed type is correct, but maybe it is also wrong_.

== Basic Feature ==

In order to *avoid assuming the correct type*, this function converts the stored string value to the suitable type for the variable - that type is stored internally in the database.

== Extended Feature ==

Another important feature is that object data (structures) are automatically serialized into a specific form in the database, and they are automatically unserialized when you are accessing the key.
