= Config Class =
The _Config_ class is a *Key-Value-Type store*.

That is a key-value store, but inside each value caries its own associated type.

Without using this feature, each time you request a field value from a database you will get a string - and you have to manually convert the value to the assumed type. _Maybe the assumed type it is the correct one, but you could also be wrong_.

== Basic Feature ==

In order to *avoid assuming the correct type*, this function converts the stored string value to the suitable type for the variable - that type is stored internally in the database.

== Extended Feature ==

Another important feature is that object data is automatically serialized into a specific form in the database, and they are automatically unserialized when you are accessing the key.

Supported types:
  * boolean
  * float
  * integer
  * string
  * json
  * hexdump (not implemented yet)
  * serialize (not recommended, use json instead)
  * yaml (proposal)
