==== _nulltype import(string name)_ ====

Imports a given class using its fully qualified name (using dot syntax instead of backslash). This mechanism is an alternative to namespaces on PHP < 5.3.0 - because namespace feature was not provided prior to PHP 5.3.0. In newer version of PHP it is still recommended to use this in order to keep your code  portable.

It has been introduced to improve cache performances over the initial Barebone MVC class autoloader. 

==== _object construct(string name[, boolean singleton])_ ====

Creates a new instance of the given class using its fully qualified name (using dot syntax). You have to import the class prior calling *construct()*. 

To create a singleton you have to pass *true* as second argument.

====  _require_object(string name[, callable callback])_ ====

Creates the required object after it automatically loads the class.
