= MVC Dispatcher - Introduction =

The dispatcher is the core of the framework.

The dispatcher is mainly responsible to
  * read and parse the request 
  * serve the response to the client 
  * delegate anything in between

Barebone MVC class naming convention is following the [http://www.php-fig.org/ PHP Framework Interoperability Group] Standard: *[http://www.php-fig.org/psr/psr-0/ PSR-0 Autoloading Standard]*

== Import a Class ==

=== `import()` ===

{{{
nulltype import(string name) throws ClassNotFoundException, InvalidArgumentException
}}}

Imports a given class using its fully qualified name (but using dot syntax instead of backslash). This mechanism is emulating namespaces on PHP < 5.3.0 - because namespace feature was not provided by the language prior to PHP 5.3.0. In newer version of PHP it is still recommended to use this in order to keep your code  portable.

|| *name* ||  fully qualified `name` of the class (but using dot syntax instead of backslash) ||
|| *returns* || `null` - Nothing to return. If something is wrong and exception is thrown. ||

This function has been introduced in order to improve bytecode cache performances, additional to autoloading capability.

*Rasmus Lerdorf*: 
  To clarify, of course conditionally included files get compiled and   cached. The issue is not the included files but the resulting conditionally defined classes and functions needing to be redefined on every request. Whether that is significant or not comes down to the specifics of the situation, but there is no doubt that it is slower. It comes down to a NOP vs. a FETCH_CLASS, for example and the NOP is obviously way faster.

*Example:*
{{{

// Using import, instead of doing something like:
require_once 'Foo/class.Bar.php';
$controller = new Foo_Bar();

// you will do something like:
import('Foo.Bar');
$controller = create_instance('Foo.Bar');
}}}

== Create a new object ==

=== `create_instance()` ===

{{{
object create_instance(string name) throws ClassNotFoundException
object create_instance(string name, dictionary properties) throws ClassNotFoundException
}}}

Creates a new instance of the given class using its fully qualified name (but using dot syntax instead of backslash). Note that you have to import the class using `import()` before calling `create_instance()`. 

|| *name* || class fully qualified `name` (but using dot syntax instead of backslash) ||
|| *returns* || On success, returns a reference to a new instance. If something is wrong and exception is thrown.  ||

*Example:*
{{{
// For example instead of the following statement
// as you would use it for PHP >= 5.3.0
$obj = new \foo\bar\ClassName();

// or prior to PHP 5.3.0
$obj = new foo_bar_ClassName();

// you would normally have the following:
$obj = create_instance('foo.bar.ClassName');
}}}

== Get reference to the single instance ==

=== `get_instance()` ===

{{{
object get_instance(string name) throws ClassNotFoundException, InstantiationException
}}}

Retrieves a reference to the _single instance of the type_.

|| *name* || fully qualified class `name` (but using dot syntax instead of backslash) ||
|| *returns* || On success, returns a reference to the single instance. If something is wrong and exception is thrown. ||

*IMPORTANT:* Given type is required to implement a mechanism to create and return the instance, either:
  # implement _a function with the same name as the class_ that implements singleton behavior and _define a public constructor_; but in this case the user must ensure that constructor is not called when singleton function (same name as the class) is used;
  # implement `instance()` or `getInstance()` method and _define a private constructor_;

=== `singleton()` ===

{{{
object singleton(string name)
}}}

It is the singleton formal factory method provided by the framework.

|| *name* || fully qualified class `name` (but using dot syntax instead of backslash)  ||
|| *returns* || On success, returns a reference to the single instance. If something is wrong and exception is thrown ||

This is especially useful to create singletons of classes provided by third party libraries.

Use this function when you want to ensure usage of a single instance but don't want to create a function for each type, add a `getInstance()` or `instance()` method to each class or refactor libraries to change constructors access level.

=== `require_object()` ===

{{{
object require_object(string name)

object require_object(string name, callable callback)
}}}

Creates the required object after it automatically loads the class. 

|| *name* || fully qualified class `name` (but using dot syntax instead of backslash)  ||
|| *callback* || <div>The `callback` which is invoked on the `object` after its creation and which shall return the `object` that is further used.</div><div> This is especially useful when do you want to clone the object or extend object with new properties, etc.</div> ||
|| *returns* || ... ||

If a callback is provided, then the object is passed to the callback and the return value of the callback is fetched back.

The main diference between `require_object()` versus `import()` and `create_instance()` is that `require_object()` is used to loading the class on demand since `import()` is used to load the class at the beginning of script execution.

=== `require_class()` ===

{{{
object require_class(string name)

object require_class(string name, callable callback)
}}}

|| *name* || fully qualified class `name` (but using dot syntax instead of backslash)  ||
|| *callback* || ... ||
|| *returns* || ... ||

=== `set_flashdata()` ===

=== `get_flashdata()` ===

=== `log_message()` ===

{{{
log_message(integer level, string message)
}}}

The `level` is compatible with the `syslog()` and `trigger_error()` functions.

|| `syslog()` || ... || ... || ... || ... ||
|| `LOG_EMERG` || 0 || system is unusable ||
|| `LOG_ALERT` || 1 || error conditions ||
|| `LOG_CRIT`  || 2 || critical conditions ||
|| `LOG_ERR` || 3 || error conditions || `E_ERROR` || 1 ||
|| `LOG_WARNING` || 4 || warning conditions || `E_WARNING` || 2 ||
|| `LOG_NOTICE` || 5 || normal but significant condition || `E_NOTICE` || 8 ||
|| `LOG_INFO` || 6 || informational || `E_INFO` || 0 ||
|| `LOG_DEBUG` || 7 || debug-level messages ||
|| ... || ... || Compile-time parse errors || `E_PARSE` || 4 ||
|| ... || ... || ... || E_STRICT || 2048 ||
|| ... || ... || User-generated error message || `E_USER_ERROR` || 256 ||
|| ... || ... || User-generated warning message || `E_USER_WARNING` || 512 ||
|| ... || ... || User-generated notice message || `E_USER_NOTICE`|| 1024 ||

=== `trace_query()` ===

{{{
nulltype trace_query(void)
}}}

TO BE REMOVED. Not a good idea to call this manually.

=== `json_success()`  ===

{{{
nulltype json_success(boolean success)
}}}
