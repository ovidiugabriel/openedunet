==== _nulltype import(string name[, false])_ ====

Imports a given class using its fully qualified name (but using dot syntax instead of backslash). This mechanism is emulating namespaces on PHP < 5.3.0 - because namespace feature was not provided by the language prior to PHP 5.3.0. In newer version of PHP it is still recommended to use this in order to keep your code  portable.

It has been introduced, to improve bytecode cache performances, as a replacement of the initial Barebone MVC class autoloader. 

==== _object construct(string name)_ ====

Creates a new instance of the given class using its fully qualified name (but using dot syntax instead of backslash). Note that you have to import the class using *import()* before calling *construct()*. 

==== _object construct(string name, true)_ ====

To use a _single instance of the type_ you have to pass *true* as second argument to the function. 

Given type is required to:
  # Implement a *getInstance()* method either:
    * implement *Singleton* interface with *instance()* method
    * OR implement *ISingleton* interface with *getInstance()* method
  # Define a private constructor;

This behaviour can be overrided by implementing a function with the same name as the class.

==== _object singleton(string name)_ ====

It is the singleton formal factory method provided by the framework.

====  _require_object(string name[, callable callback])_ ====

Creates the required object after it automatically loads the class.

==== _require_class(string name[, callable callback])_ ====
