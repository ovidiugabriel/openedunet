= Introduction =

Generally speaking Smarty extensions are integrated using Smarty Plugins (more info at http://www.smarty.net/docs/en/plugins.tpl)


= Details =

Barebone MVC is using a thin module of smarty plugins to allow: 

  * human language translations (e.g. from English to German)
  * conversions between _Query Strings_ and _Search Engine Friendly URLs_
  * build _Query Strings_ or _Search Engine Friendly URLs_ from <controller, task> pairs

There are some plans to extend the Smarty layer with more functions in order to allow web designers to add some plus functionality - for instance Spry framework usage - with less code to write.
