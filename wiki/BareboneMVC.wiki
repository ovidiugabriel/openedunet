= What is Barebone MVC (BBMVC)? =

It is a very simple framework which enables clear, rapid and secure development of PHP applications.
It is modular, object oriented and uses Smarty as a template system.

Long story short: all parameters will be automatically checked for security. The required modules, functions and templates will be automatically called and loaded.

= How BBMVC works? =

Basically, I want every single webpage to be called via index.php, so that I (and you) can have a better control of everything.
For this, I suggest the following URL "format": http://domain.com/index.php?module=CdCollection&action=cdEdit&cd_id=3&other_param=1
Mark the module and action parameters, BBMVC will be looking for these.

First, let's talk about the module.
One module consists of 4 components:

  # `/modules/CdCollection/class.CdCollection.php` - main PHP code for the module
  # `/modules/CdCollection/class.CdCollectionSecurity.php` - PHP code responsible for module security
  # `/modules/CdCollection/class.CdCollectionSeo.php` - PHP code responsible for SEO (search engine friendly URLs, for now)
  # `/templates/CdCollection/` - if it's not clear yet, templates of the module are located here

The security and SEO part are not mandatory.

Every `class.ClassName.php` file should hold the `ClassName` class.

The dispatcher(BBMVC) checks for the existence of the above mentioned folders, files and classes.

The `CdCollection` class should have a public method called `cdEdit`.

[Security checks are done, see below]

If no error occurs, then the `CdCollection->cdEdit()` method is called and the `/templates/CdCollection/cdEdit.tpl` template is displayed.
