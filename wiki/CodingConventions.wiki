== PSR Standards ==

==== PSR-0 Autoloading ====

==== PSR-1 Basic Coding ====

  # PHP code MUST use the long `<?php ?>` tags; it MUST NOT use the other tag variations. (Also see PSR-2.10)
  # Code files MUST use only UTF-8 {`"default_encoding": "UTF-8"`}
  # Files SHOULD either declare symbols (classes, functions, constants, etc.) or cause side-effects (e.g. generate output, change .ini settings,explicit use of require or include, connecting to external services, emitting errors or exceptions, modifying global or static variables, reading from or writing to a file, etc.) but SHOULD NOT do both.
  # Namespaces and classes MUST follow PSR-0.
  # Class names MUST be declared in `StudlyCaps`

==== PSR-2 Coding Style ====

  # Code MUST use 4 spaces for indenting, not tabs. {`"tab_size": 4, "translate_tabs_to_spaces": true`}
  # There MUST NOT be a hard limit on line length; the soft limit MUST be 120 characters; {` "rulers": [80, 120]`}
  # Visibility MUST be declared on all properties and methods; 
  # `abstract` and `final` MUST be declared before the visibility; 
  # The `var` keyword MUST NOT be used to declare a property. 
  # Property names SHOULD NOT be prefixed with a single underscore to indicate `protected` or `private` visibility - since keywords are available.
  # Opening braces for control structures MUST go on the same line, and closing braces MUST go on the next line after the body.
  # All code files MUST use the Unix LF (linefeed) line ending. {`"default_line_ending": "unix"`}
  # All code files MUST end with a single blank line. {`"ensure_newline_at_eof_on_save": true`}
  # The closing `?>` tag MUST be omitted from files containing only PHP.
  # PHP keywords MUST be in lower case. The PHP constants `true`, `false`, and `null` MUST be in lower case.
  # The `extends` and `implements` keywords MUST be declared on the same line as the class name.
  # Lists of implements MAY be split across multiple lines, where each subsequent line is indented once. When doing so, the first item in the list MUST be on the next line, and there MUST be only one interface per line.
  # In the argument list, there MUST NOT be a space before each comma, and there MUST be one space after each comma.
  # Method arguments with default values MUST go at the end of the argument list.
  # Argument lists MAY be split across multiple lines, where each subsequent line is indented once. When doing so, the first item in the list MUST be on the next line, and there MUST be only one argument per line.
  # The keyword `elseif` SHOULD be used instead of else if so that all control keywords look like single words.

==== PSR-4 Improved Autoloading ====

== Aditional specific conventions ==

  # Usage of `static` methods and `static` local variables is discouraged. Make sure you have an object oriented or a functional design before using `static`. And make sure you are not forcing procedural style over classes by using `static` in excess. If you still need to use `static` methods make sure that `static` keyword is written on the line above the method signature.

{{{
    /** 
     * I am using this because it is similar with @staticmethod used in Python.
     */
    static
    public function FunctionName($value='') {
        # code...
    }
}}}

== Naming Conventions ==

*What about letter cases and underscores?*

We have a very _liberal approach_ in this area. 

As _Linus Torvalds_ said: _"Coding style is very personal, and I won't force my views on anybody, but this is what goes for anything that I have to be able to maintain"_.

Maybe it is confusing,
but it is important to keep in mind only one rule: *don't put everything in the same basket*.

  # Constants are always `SCREAMING_CAPS`;
  # Local variables, object properties and function parameters are `snake_case`;
  # Functions and methods are generally `camelCase`;
  # Classes (type names) are always `StudlyCaps`;

Usually I stick to the same convetions as [http://blog.lmorchard.com/2013/01/23/naming-conventions Les Orchard].

|| Variable || mutable || All lower case, words separated by underscores. ||
|| Constant || immutable || All upper case, words separated by underscores. ||
|| Functions/methods || immutable and callable things || Mixed camel case, first letter always lower case. ||
|| Structs and classes ||  immutable and instantiatable things || Mixed camel case, first letter always upper case. ||

These rules are not mandatory, they are just advisory and won't be enforced on contributors.

After all, computer programming is about data structures, algorithms, architectures and interfaces and not so much about text formatting and typography.

== Design Principles ==

Forget about CodingConventions. We are more concerned with:
  * [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Don%27t_repeat_yourself DRY Principle]
  * [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Separation_of_concerns Separation of concerns]
  * [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Code_reuse Code reuse]
  * [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abstraction_principle_%28programming%29 Abstraction principles]

And speaking about DRY Principle: *Avoid [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Copy_and_paste_programming Copy and paste programming] and [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cargo_cult_programming Cargo cult programming] at any price, dead or alive, no matter what.*

[http://ilpverymuch.wordpress.com/2014/06/23/10-steps-to-becoming-a-better-programmer/ 10 steps to becoming a better programmer]

*Other anti-patterns to avoid:*
  
  * [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Copy_and_paste_programming Copy and paste programming]
  * [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Duplicate_code Duplicated code]: identical or very similar code exists in more than one location.
  * [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cargo_cult_programming Cargo cult programming]
  * *Code Distrust*: checking to see if a `boolean`-typed variable is something other than `true` or `false`; Using `if (true == (true == x))` instead of `if (x)` when `x` is a boolean variable, etc.
  * *Smart UI Anti-Pattern* (See: [http://geekswithblogs.net/gregorymalcolm/archive/2009/07/14/user-interface-patterns.aspx Using Interface Patterns] - includes details on MVC and so on)
  * [http://c2.com/cgi/wiki?ArrowAntiPattern Arrow Anti-Pattern]: It often develops when a programmer applies the 'One Return Per Function rule' blindly and in poor taste
  * [http://www.leepoint.net/JavaBasics/methods/method-commentary/methcom-30-multiple-return.html One Return Per Function ]: simple readable code in more important than following any arbitrary rule.
  * *Loop-switch sequence*: Encoding a set of sequential steps using a switch within a loop statement
  * [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Error_hiding Error hiding]: Catching an error message before it can be shown to the user and either showing nothing or showing a meaningless message. Checking results without throwing exceptions or forwarding error codes and messages to both caller and logging system.
  * *Pinball Programming*: Using code that doesn't throw exceptions, and not checking the output result. Blindly using running over errors with faith that everything is fine since the system has `display_errors` muted.
  * *Hard code*: Embedding assumptions about the environment of a system in its implementation
  * *Inappropriate intimacy*: a class that has dependencies on implementation details of another class.
  * *Fat Controller Anti-Pattern*
  * [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/God_object God Object]: Concentrating too many functions in a single part of the design (class)
  * [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Object_orgy Object Orgy]:  Failing to properly encapsulate objects permitting unrestricted access to their internals
  * *Premature optimization*: Coding early-on for perceived efficiency, sacrificing good design, maintainability, and sometimes even real-world efficiency - D. Knuth: "We should forget about small efficiencies, say about 97% of the time: premature optimization is the root of all evil."

Over engineering? Redundant stuff?

Let's have an example: 
{{{
if (numMines > 0)
{
   enabled = true;
}
else
{
   enabled = false;
}
}}}

Why would you do that when you could just use:
{{{
enabled = (numMines > 0);
}}}

== PHP specific standards ==

  # Access type `abstract` for interface methods must be omitted.
