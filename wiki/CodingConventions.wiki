==== PSR-1 Basic Coding ====

  # PHP code MUST use the long `<?php ?>` tags; it MUST NOT use the other tag variations.
  # Code files MUST use only UTF-8 without BOM.
  # Files SHOULD either declare symbols (classes, functions, constants, etc.) or cause side-effects (e.g. generate output, change .ini settings,explicit use of require or include, connecting to external services, mitting errors or exceptions, modifying global or static variables, reading from or writing to a file, etc.) but SHOULD NOT do both.
  # Namespaces and classes MUST follow PSR-0.
  # Class names MUST be declared in `StudlyCaps`

==== PSR-2 Coding Style ====

  # Code MUST use 4 spaces for indenting, not tabs.
  # There MUST NOT be a hard limit on line length; the soft limit MUST be 120 characters;
  # Visibility MUST be declared on all properties and methods; abstract and final MUST be declared before the visibility;

==== PSR-3 Logger Interface ====


==== PSR-4 Improved Autoloading ====

==== Aditional ====

  # Usage of `static` methods and `static` local variables is discouraged
