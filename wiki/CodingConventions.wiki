The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT", "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119.

==== PSR-0 Autoloading ====

==== PSR-1 Basic Coding ====

  # PHP code MUST use the long <?php ?> tags ~~or the short-echo <?= ?> tags~~; it MUST NOT use the other tag variations.
  # Code files MUST use only UTF-8 without BOM for PHP code.
  # Files SHOULD either declare symbols (classes, functions, constants, etc.) or cause side-effects (e.g. generate output, change .ini settings, etc.) but SHOULD NOT do both.
  # Namespaces and classes MUST follow PSR-0.

The phrase "side effects" means execution of logic not directly related to declaring classes, functions, constants, etc., merely from including the file.

"Side effects" include but are not limited to: generating output, explicit use of require or include, connecting to external services, modifying ini settings, emitting errors or exceptions, modifying global or static variables, reading from or writing to a file, and so on.
