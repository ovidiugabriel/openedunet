Kind of tag.  The value depends on the language.  For C and
        C++ these kinds are recommended:

        c   class name
        d   define (from #define XXX)
        e   enumerator
        f   function or method name
        F   file name
        g   enumeration name
        m   member (of structure or class data)
        p   function prototype
        s   structure name
        t   typedef
        u   union name
        v   variable
        When this field is omitted, the kind of tag is undefined.
```
